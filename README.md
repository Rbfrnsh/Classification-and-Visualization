# Classification and Visualization Six Class Abnormalities of Heart Fetals Using Convolutional Neural Network and Saliency Map
This research is conducted to perform the classification of 6 classes of fetal heart image abnormalities using Convolutional Neural Network and Saliency Map. The proposed models for classification are CNN with custom layers, ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. The hyperparameters used in this study include 50 and 100 epochs, batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32, and a learning rate of 0.0001.
